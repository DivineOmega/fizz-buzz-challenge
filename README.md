# Fizz Buzz Challenge

Fizz Buzz is classic programming challenge. This repo aims to contain Fizz Buzz implementations for as many languages as possible.

## Want to submit an implementation?

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/DivineOmega/fizz-buzz-challenge).
2. Write your implementation. Be sure to name the file `language_method.ext`. For example, a basic Python implementation could be called `python_basic.py`.
4. Submit a pull request!

## Requirements

Any Fizz Buzz implementation will be accepted, with the following restrictions.

* Implementations must present (in any fashion) a delimited output of Fizz Buzz counting to 45 (the 3rd FizzBuzz).
* Implementations must not be dangerous or negatively affect the privacy and/or security of people who compile and/or run them.

## Example output

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, FizzBuzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, 37, 38, Fizz, Buzz, 41, Fizz, 43, 44, FizzBuzz

# About Fizz Buzz

> Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
